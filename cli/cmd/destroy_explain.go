	Summary: "`destroy` tears down the cloud-side footprint of the app: " +
		"serverless compute + CDN/storage on Cloudflare, or the " +
		"on-disk installation on VPS targets. Driven by the same " +
		"nextdeploy.yml as ship — resource names are derived from app " +
		"metadata, so stale configs will miss resources.",

			Title:     "Load config + metadata",
			Narrative: "Reads nextdeploy.yml for target type + provider, and .nextdeploy/metadata.json for the app name. Missing metadata is a warning — destroy proceeds with whatever cfg declares.",
			Ref:       "cli/cmd/destroy.go:22",
			Function:  "config.Load + json.Unmarshal(metadata.json)",

			Title:     "Branch by target type",
			Narrative: "Serverless route initializes the Cloudflare provider and calls Destroy. VPS route opens an SSH session to each configured server and issues a daemon-side cleanup command.",

			Output:    "dispatched to serverless or vps destroyer",

			Notes:     []string{"R2 bucket delete fails if non-empty; we don't sweep objects yet."},

			Title:     "DNS guidance",
			Narrative: "Prints the list of DNS records the user should remove from their DNS provider (custom domain CNAMEs, verification TXTs). Manual step — Cloudflare-managed zones get cleaned automatically.",
