	Use:   "provision",
	Short: "Provision cloud resources for Next.js deployment",
	Long: `
The 'provision' command automates the setup of required cloud infrastructure for deploying
Next.js applications. It handles the creation and configuration of:

Core Components:
- Container Registry repositories for Docker image storage
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with least-privilege policies
- Dedicated deployment users with appropriate permissions
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for consistent environments

This command ensures your cloud environment is properly configured
before application deployment, following infrastructure best practices.
This command should be built in cloud agnostic way. By providing user with as many cloud options as
possible. User should be able to pass their prefered cloud as flag.
