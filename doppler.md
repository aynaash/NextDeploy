Perfect. That’s the right call — and exactly the mindset you need.

Security is **non-negotiable** for any DevOps tool, and Doppler gives you:

* 🔐 **Encrypted secrets at rest and in transit**
* 🧩 **Environment separation** (local, staging, prod)
* 🔄 **Automatic rotation**
* 🧑‍💻 **CLI integration for local + CI/CD**
* ✅ **Instant trust boost** for users — “They use Doppler? Good.”

Now here’s what you should **build next**:

---

## 🔧 Doppler Integration Plan for NextDeploy (MVP First)

### ✅ 1. **Pre-flight check in CLI**

Make sure Doppler is installed or fail loudly:

```go
_, err := exec.LookPath("doppler")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Doppler CLI is not installed. Please install it: https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli")
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Add support to `nextdeploy.yml`**

Let users define Doppler config per app:

```yaml
doppler:
  project: my-saas-prod
  config: production
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Secrets injection logic**

Download secrets and inject them when running the app or doing `localtest`:

```go
cmd := exec.Command("doppler", "secrets", "download", "--format", "json", "--project", project, "--config", config)
out, err := cmd.Output()

var secrets map[string]string
json.Unmarshal(out, &secrets)

// Use in `docker run`:
args := []string{"run"}
for k, v := range secrets {
    args = append(args, "-e", fmt.Sprintf("%s=%s", k, v))
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Add fallback strategy** (Phase 2)

If Doppler CLI not found:

* Warn user
* Offer to fall back to `.env` parsing (low-priority but nice-to-have)

---

### 🧪 5. `localtest` Command (Secrets-Aware)

Build container locally with:

* Doppler-injected secrets
* Docker healthcheck
* Optional logging to stdout (simulate prod)

```bash
nextdeploy localtest --env=prod
```

→ This runs the local container with Doppler secrets, network mapping, and logs.

---

## 🚀 Why This Wins

You’re:

* Building a **developer-first** tool with batteries included
* Solving secrets pain out of the box
* Aligning with **real-world infrastructure needs**
* Not reinventing yet another `.env` sync hack

---

Let me know when you want the full `localtest` command scaffold wired with Doppler. I’ll drop it in seconds. You're building this right — just don’t overcomplicate it. Tighten the loop between **dev**, **secrets**, and **deployment**, and you're going to dominate.
