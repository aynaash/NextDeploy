## 🚀 Introducing NextDeploy CLI — One-Command Deployments for Modern Web Apps

Imagine deploying your **Next.js app to a production VPS** with just one command. No Vercel, no platform lock-in, and no monthly surprises. Just your **code, Docker, and a single CLI tool**.

That’s what **NextDeploy CLI** is all about.

### 🧰 What is NextDeploy CLI?

NextDeploy is an open-source CLI tool that helps developers:

* 📦 Dockerize Next.js apps instantly
* 📡 Deploy to any cloud VPS via SSH
* 📊 Stream container logs and metrics
* 🔐 Stay in control of infrastructure
* 🌍 Ship apps without depending on big platforms

It’s **stack-agnostic**, **extensible**, and built for developers who value control and clarity.

### 🧪 Built by Developers, for Developers

Whether you’re:

* Building client apps,
* Running microservices on a budget VPS,
* Or launching a SaaS MVP,

NextDeploy gives you **production workflows** without production headaches.

Our goal is simple: **automated deployments, with developer-first ergonomics.**

### 🤝 Contribute, Fork, and Collaborate
