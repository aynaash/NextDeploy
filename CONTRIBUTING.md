# üõ†Ô∏è Contributing to NextDeploy

## Welcome, Developer.

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **NextDeploy** ‚Äî the focused, fast, and fully self-hosted deployment engine for **Next.js applications**.

We're building this project with a strong set of principles, so before you dive in, please take a moment to understand the philosophy that drives the codebase.

## üö© What NextDeploy *Is*

NextDeploy is a **Next.js-only deployment tool**.  
It gives developers full control over shipping their Next.js apps to any VPS or infrastructure they own.

- It‚Äôs **framework-specific** by design.
- It‚Äôs **plugin-free** to stay lean, testable, and secure.
- It‚Äôs **CLI-first**, with an optional daemon for orchestration and monitoring.
- It‚Äôs **open-source**, and we want contributions that push it forward without bloating it sideways.

---

## üö´ What NextDeploy *Is Not*

To avoid confusion:

- We do **not** support other frontend frameworks (e.g., Vue, React SPA, Astro, Remix).
- We do **not** support vendor-specific hosting (e.g., Fly.io, Heroku, Vercel).
- We do **not** include a plugin system or third-party extensibility layer.
- We do **not** aim to be a one-size-fits-all DevOps tool.

This lets us keep the project simple, powerful, and laser-focused on Next.js.

## ‚úÖ What We‚Äôd Love From You

If you're aligned with that vision, here‚Äôs how you can help:

- Improve the Next.js deployment flow
- Add features to the orchestration daemon
- Fix bugs or edge cases in the CLI/daemon lifecycle
- Make metrics, health checks, or logging cleaner or more insightful
- Write clear documentation, examples, and error messages
- Help us improve developer experience for real-world VPS deployments

## üß± Design Philosophy

1. **Next.js Only**  
   We don't support other frameworks. That‚Äôs a strength, not a limitation.

2. **No Plugins, No Bloat**  
   All features are native. If you want to add functionality, fork the project and propose it as a PR.

3. **Self-Hosted, Always**  
   NextDeploy gives developers freedom and control ‚Äî no platform lock-in, ever.

4. **Open Source, With a Backbone**  
   We move fast, review carefully, and reject what doesn't fit the mission. It‚Äôs not personal ‚Äî it's about protecting the project.
