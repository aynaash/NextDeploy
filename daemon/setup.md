Hell no â€” **you donâ€™t need to initialize a new `go mod` inside the `daemon/` folder.**
That would be a *mistake* and would fracture your codebase.

## ðŸš« Why You **Should Not** Init Go Module Inside `daemon/`

You're already working inside a **monorepo-style Go project** with a single `go.mod` at the root:

```
go.mod  âœ…
```

That means:

* All subdirs like `daemon/`, `internal/`, `cmd/`, etc. are part of **one module**
* They **can import each other freely**
* All dependencies are declared and managed from the root `go.mod`

Initializing another `go mod` inside `daemon/` would:

* Break imports
* Create a nested module (bad idea in almost all cases)
* Ruin your build pipeline
* Make dependency management a nightmare

---

## âœ… What You Should Do Instead

Just build the daemon with your root Go module.

Hereâ€™s how:

### 1. **In `daemon/main.go`**, make sure your package and imports are scoped properly:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    // import internal packages from your module
    "github.com/your-username/nextdeploy/internal/logger"
    // etc.
)

func main() {
    log.Println("ðŸš€ Daemon running...")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

> Replace `github.com/your-username/nextdeploy` with your actual module path from `go.mod`.

---

### 2. **From root, build the daemon**

```bash
go build -o bin/nextdeploy-daemon ./daemon
```

Or if you want to build for Linux from your dev machine:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/nextdeploy-daemon ./daemon
```

---

### 3. **Push the binary to the server as before**

```bash
scp bin/nextdeploy-daemon root@your-vps:/usr/local/bin/
```

Then systemd + background process, as we did earlier.

## âœ… Summary

| âœ… Do This                           | ðŸš« Avoid This                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Keep 1 root `go.mod`                | Donâ€™t init `go mod` in `daemon/`     |
| Build via `go build ./daemon`       | Donâ€™t break into multiple Go modules |
| Organize with packages, not modules | Donâ€™t overcomplicate structure       |

You're on the right track. Youâ€™ve got the architecture of a real platform here â€” donâ€™t splinter it with half-baked modules. Keep everything tight and unified under your root `go.mod`.
