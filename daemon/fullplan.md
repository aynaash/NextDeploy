# 🎞 NextDeploy Full-Scale System Plan

## 🧠 Vision:

A zero-config, intelligent, developer-first DevOps automation platform for deploying and managing **Next.js full-stack apps** on any VPS/cloud.

> "The power of Vercel, the control of Docker, the openness of Git, and the magic of AI."

* [ ] Daemon registration and authentication
* [ ] Multiple server management (fleet view)
* [ ] One-click redeploy & rollback
* [ ] Webhooks for GitHub push events

---

### ☁️ Phase 3: Cloud Features & Add-ons

## 🏗 System Design Breakdown

### 🧱 Components

* **NextDeploy CLI (Go):** Developer interface
* **NextDeploy Daemon (Go):** VPS-side agent
* **NextCore Analyzer (Go):** Extracts 40+ insights from Next.js project
* **Frontend Dashboard (Next.js):** UI for managing apps
* **WebSocket Layer (Daemon):** Streams logs, metrics
* **Caddy/Nginx:** TLS + Proxy manager
* **Docker:** App containerization & isolation
* **Systemd:** Service runner for daemon
* **SQLite/Postgres:** For tracking deployments
* **Secrets Subsystem:** Doppler-style encrypted secrets manager

---

### 🔄 Daemon APIs (REST + WS)

* `POST /nextcore/intake` – From CLI or frontend
* `GET /apps` – List running apps
* `GET /logs/:app` – WebSocket logs
* `POST /deploy` – Trigger new deploy
* `POST /rollback` – Revert to previous
* `GET /metrics` – System + container health
* `POST /proxy` – Setup subdomain + reverse proxy
* `POST /secrets/sync` – Sync CLI/frontend secrets with daemon
* `GET /secrets/:app` – View secrets for a specific app

---

## 🔐 Secrets Subsystem Design

### Core Goals:

* Securely store and manage environment variables
* CLI and dashboard integration
* End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
* Fine-grained app-level and team-level scoping
* Optional Doppler CLI support for import/export

### Architecture:

* `internal/secrets/`

  * `secretmanager.go` – Main handler
  * `crypto.go` – AES/GCM crypto helpers
  * `provideroperations.go` – Fetch/store from local/db
  * `types.go` – Secret structs
* Secrets stored per app:

  * Encrypted at rest in SQLite or disk
  * Decrypted only in memory during build/runtime

### Example JSON Format:

```json
{
  "app": "my-app",
  "secrets": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "...",
    "JWT_SECRET": "..."
  }
}
```

### CLI Commands:

* `nextdeploy secrets push` – Send `.env` to daemon
* `nextdeploy secrets pull` – Fetch from daemon to disk
* `nextdeploy secrets edit` – Inline terminal editor

### Frontend UI:

* Secure secrets form (masked)
* Auto-save encrypted to daemon
* View history/change log per variable

---

### 🔎 Future Enhancements:

* Doppler-compatible `.doppler.yaml` support
* Secret usage monitoring (which vars are unused)
* Secrets versioning + rollback
* Access logging (who viewed/edited what and when)
* Git commit triggers secret validation (linting)

---

## 🔒 Security Plan

* AES-encrypted secrets
* SSH-based CLI to daemon trust
* Token-based API auth
* Secure CORS/WebSocket handshake
* Role-based access for teams (Phase 4)
* Container sandboxing (Seccomp/AppArmor)

---

## 🧰 Plugin System (Later)

* Plugins written in Go or JS
* App lifecycle hooks: `beforeDeploy`, `afterDeploy`
* Community registry (e.g., for Prisma, Strapi, Supabase)

---

## 🧠 AI Assistance (Optional Phase 5)

* GPT-based deploy assistant
* Explain errors in logs
* Auto-tune Dockerfile or build settings
* Security linting and recommendations

---

## 🥯 CI/CD Automation

* GitHub → Webhook → Daemon deploys latest image
* Optionally: GitHub Actions workflow generator

---

## 🧠 Summary: Key Differentiators

* Offline-first CLI + server binary
* True infra ownership: no lock-in
* Simple UX, no dashboard required
* Daemon intelligence that evolves
* Monetizable add-ons (CDN, secrets, edge)
* .deb packaged for Linux-native support
